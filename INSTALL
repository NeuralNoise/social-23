Installing the social script is not exactly a user-oriented task.
Here are instructions as of now to install it.

STEP 1:
Create a mySQL database and paste the file
./setup/initsql.sql into a query and run it
this will set up the database structure for you

STEP 2:
Rename config.php.default to config.php
Edit config.php to suit your needs

STEP 3:
Visit SERVER_ROOT/setup/engine.php and verify
that it has written the array to the screen.
If you do not know PHP, this will look strange

STEP 4:
Test your new installation and delete the setup
directory.
